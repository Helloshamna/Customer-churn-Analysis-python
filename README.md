# Customer-churn-Analysis-python
Customer Churn Analysis is a data-driven approach to identifying why customers leave a business and how to improve retention strategies. Using Python, we can analyze customer behavior, predict churn, and take proactive measures.
## Key Steps in Churn Analysis:
Data Collection & Preprocessing

Load customer data using pandas (e.g., customer demographics, services, tenure, monthly charges).
Handle missing values and convert categorical data into numerical form (LabelEncoder, OneHotEncoding).
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Use matplotlib and seaborn to visualize churn trends (e.g., churn by contract type, internet service, support services).
Identify key factors influencing churn, like high monthly charges or lack of tech support.
Feature Engineering

Create new features or transform existing ones to improve model performance.
Machine Learning Model Training

Train models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, or SVM using sklearn.
Use train-test split and cross-validation for better accuracy.
## Model Evaluation & Interpretation

Evaluate performance using metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
Use SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to interpret feature importance.
Business Impact
Helps businesses identify high-risk customers before they leave.
Enables targeted retention strategies, such as discounts or personalized support.
Improves decision-making by providing data-driven insights.
